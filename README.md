# Usage

A docker compose file is provided to make it simple to run both the agent and
the Go test app.

```console
# Source the testing environment
$ source env.sh
# Start the app and agent containers using docker-compose
$ docker-compose up --pull 'always' --build --attach app
```

> [!NOTE] 
> If you would like to connect to a staging run you must run `source env.sh --staging` to set up the env

You can also pass custom tags with DD_TAGS and a custom service name with
DD_SERVICE.

## Attacking the app

You should be able to attack the app on port 7777 of your machine =)

For example:

1. LFI attempt:
   ```console
   curl -v --path-as-is 'http://127.0.0.1:7777/../../../etc/passwd'
   ```

2. SQLi attempt:
   ```console
   curl -v 'http://127.0.0.1:7777/sql?k=select%20*%20from%20users%20where%201%3D1%20union%20select%20*%20from%20cb'
   ```

3. SQLi vulnerability:
   ```console
   curl -v 'http://localhost:7777/products?category=%27%20union%20select%20*%20from%20user%20%27'
   ```

3. Attack attempt through the HTTP body:
   ```console
   curl -v -XPUT -d 'your json body payload' 'http://localhost:7777/api/catalog/'
   ```

4. SSRF Exploit Prevention:
   ```console
   curl -v 'http://localhost:7777/ssrf?host=169.254.169.254'
   ```

Note: you can forge the ip you want by adding `-H "X-Forwarded-For: <any_ip>"` to your curl command

### User blocking

1. Register a user on 'http://127.0.0.1:7777/registration.html'

2. Login on 'http://127.0.0.1:7777/login.html'

3. Go to 'http://127.0.0.1:7777/auth'. If the user is blocked, the blocking page should be displayed
